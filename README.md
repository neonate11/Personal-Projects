# About
I wanted to create a blackjack game that ran in the terminal, drawn entirely in ascii art, 
that required downloading no nonstandard python modules on any machine.
I also wanted it to play very similar to a casino, so you can split, doubledown, buy insurance, and play multiple hands at once. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement in gameplay features to add, or improving my code structure.
Also let me know if you find any bugs.

# How to Play:
Open your terminal, make full screen.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the game using: python3 Blackjack.py

# Sample Gameplay:
